# Garmin Routes
Converting GPX tracks and routes has never worked seamlessly on my Fenix 3 so I wrote this to perform the conversion in a reliable way.

Simply load the GPX file in the UI and hit the convert button. The equivalent FIT file will be written to the watch.

Includes a "reverse" checkbox that creates the same route as the GPX input file but in the opposite direction (start at the finisih, finish at the start).  

Does not attempt to apply any pacing in the resulting course file. Might be worth adding this in future.
